# TG Core

TG Core is a mod that does nothing but add a new Team Grad splash screen on its own. Its purpose is to provide code to all Team Grad mods, so that there is less repeating code. It also optimizes Team Grad mod load times.

### If you have trouble with the mod, or if you just want to chat, you can join the [TABS Mod Center](https://discord.gg/zrs44qyp7S).

### This mod is [**open source**](https://github.com/donkeyrat/TGCore).
